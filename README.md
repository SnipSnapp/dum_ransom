# dum_ransom
Ransomware made for learning purposes.
Uses xor and a seeded random instead of using an actual encryption method.
Things can be easily decrypted, key can be manually entered. Tries to communicate the key to an external server before launching.
Useful for testing. But not really effective at anything. 
If you're going to run it, run it in a VM. Does not try to spread. Local ransom only.
